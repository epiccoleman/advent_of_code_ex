# notes - AOC 2015

# day 3
pretty easy, but i'm afraid to say "was AOC easier in 2015?" because some real mf'er of one is probably coming up.

# day 2
Pretty simple, some nice benefits of pattern matching here for sure. Got a bit clever with the difference operator to get the minimum two sides.

# day 1
pattern matching is cool, i really like how simple the solution for day 1 is. i wonder a bit if reduce_while is a smell, but I think it's def the right tool for the job here.
