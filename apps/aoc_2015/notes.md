# notes - AOC 2015

# day 5
guess that the nasty regex one from 2020 prepared me a bit for this, i still had to get pretty gnarly though for the recurring pair thing. gross looking pipeline but hey, it works

# day 4
another easy one, thanks to erlang for having an md5 function. I guess there's probably a clever way to do this but idk what it would be.

# day 3
pretty easy, but i'm afraid to say "was AOC easier in 2015?" because some real mf'er of one is probably coming up.

# day 2
Pretty simple, some nice benefits of pattern matching here for sure. Got a bit clever with the difference operator to get the minimum two sides, which is probably poor form if anyone else ever had to care about this code, luckily for me thats not the case.

# day 1
pattern matching is cool, i really like how simple the solution for day 1 is. i wonder a bit if reduce_while is a smell, but I think it's def the right tool for the job here.
