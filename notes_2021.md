man i missed elixir.

## day 3
there is some definite slop here. this is an annoying puzzle for elixir :). One thing that might be helpful is to treat the inputs as integers, and then use Integer.digits and Integer.undigits to convert. This would get rid of some of the annoying string conversion logic and probably make everything a bit cleaner. Oh - but one problem with that, is you lose the padding. probably by the time you deal with that it's a wash between the two approaches. idk.
