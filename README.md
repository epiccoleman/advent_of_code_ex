# Advent Of Code Elixir

Repo for doin' the puzzles with Elixir. Because Elixir is fun!

## Puzzle Code Generation
You can generate scaffolding for a day's solution by running `mix day $puzzle_number $year` (e.g. `mix day 12 2020`).

This will create a module for that day's puzzle and an accompanying test module. You'd run those like `mix test test/aoc_2021/day01_test.exs`. The basic idea is that you implement each part in the appropriately named `part_1` and `part_2` functions in that day's module. These are called with the puzzle's input in the autogenerated tests.

Provide a valid session token in the root of the repo, in the `.session_token` file, to automatically download the puzzle input file!

## Tests
Run all the tests with `mix test`.

You can add a tag above a long-running test so that it doesn't get run by default like so: `@tag slow: true`

Run all the tests, including ones that take a long time, with `mix test --include slow`. Currently this takes about 5 minutes.

Also included is a `mix` task which provides a convenient shortcut for running the tests for a particular day's puzzle. You can run it like this: `mix test.aoc $day $year` (e.g. `mix test.aoc 10 2021`). You can also run `mix test.aoc.watch` to start `mix test.watch` for the given day and year.

## Benchmarks
Benchmarks using benchee exist in the test dirs for some days. You run those like `mix run test/aoc_2015/day05/day05_benchmarks.exs`. Benchmarking is cool!

## CI
A simple Github action is included, which runs the full test suite on each pushed commit.
