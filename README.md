# Advent Of Code Elixir

Repo for doin' the puzzles with Elixir. Because Elixir is fun!

Run all the tests with `mix test`.

Run all the tests, including ones that take a long time, with `mix test --include slow`. Currently this takes about 5 minutes.

Benchmarks using benchee exist in the test dirs for some days. You run those like `mix run test/aoc_2015/day05/day05_benchmarks.exs`.
